NYC Department of Education
Predictive Model for Population Growth Business Case

## Project Business Justification 	
The New York City Department of Education is the largest school district in the United States, serving 1.1 million students in over 1,800 schools. Since 2010, the city population has grown by 4.6%—the highest rate of growth since the 1920s. These trends make it incredibly important to have accurate data for city planning purposes—especially when it comes to accommodating a rapidly growing Pre-K-12 student population. An enhanced student population prediction model with more granular insights will significantly help the NYC Department of Education efficiently plan for enrollment changes and enhance school zoning efforts, so that all public school students have equal access to the resources they need.


## Project Description 
The most useful information for this business problem would most likely be something like expected population change by neighborhood.  So for a specific zip code, say 11238, the model should predict the expected population 1, 3, 5, or 10 years from now.  

A follow up to this would be a report of all zip codes in the five boroughs, ranked by percentage and total population change.
